<p>So far from my experience with the three platforms used, I think that 000webhost would be the best to store articles.
I am more familiar with the mdrive and csis server since I have used them in previous semesters.  They both seem easy to keep things organized 
when creating new documents.  Although I think it would be more confusing to try and keep articles organized.  It seems that with online articles it would
be more convenient to save and organize them on an online platform.</p>
